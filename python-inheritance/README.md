## 📌 Project Description

### **Project Purpose**  
This project provides a structured set of exercises, explanations, and learning materials focused on Python classes, inheritance, and object‑oriented programming. It is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners understand how inheritance works through step‑by‑step practice, flashcards, and guided examples.

### **Problem Solved**  
Many learners struggle with understanding how classes relate to each other, how inheritance works, and how to apply concepts like `super()`, `isinstance`, and method overriding. This project solves that by offering clear explanations and practical exercises that build confidence through repetition and real examples.

### **General Context**  
The content is ideal for students, self‑taught programmers, and anyone preparing for Python interviews or certifications. It can be used in classrooms, coding bootcamps, or personal study sessions.
